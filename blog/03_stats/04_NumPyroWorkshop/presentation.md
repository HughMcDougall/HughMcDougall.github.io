# A Brief Introduction to NumPyro
## Presentation for Swinburne Cookies & Code 28/7/25

This is a page to accompany a presentation to the Swinburne University "Cookies and Code" meeting on Monday 28/7/25, outlining some of the features of `JAX` and `NumPyro` and briefly explaining the fundamentals of using them. I've intentionally kept as much brief as I can, with more involved walk-throughs detailed in my main [NumPyro Guide](../../02_numpyro/blog_numpyrohome.html).
