# Quasar Stats & Reverberation Mapping
## USQ Astro Colloquium 9 May 2025

This is a recording of a talk I gave at the USQ seminar at the springfield campus. It discussed my first two papers: one a review of the full set of historical reverberation mapping data in the literature, and the other my RM fitting code `LITMUS`, which improves on the existing state of the art methods.

You can find the slides [here](./slides.html), and a video recording below.
