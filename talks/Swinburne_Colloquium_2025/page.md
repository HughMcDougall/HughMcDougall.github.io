# Quasar Stats & Reverberation Mapping
## Swinburne Colloquium 9 May 2025

This is a recording of a talk I gave at the Swinburne Center for Astronomy and Supercomputing. This is part of a series of talks I gave in early-mid 2025 as a part of an extended trip across Australia's east coast, all focusing on the first two papers of my PhD. 

You can find the slides [here](./slides.html), and a video recording below.
