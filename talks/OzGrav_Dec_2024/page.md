# Statistical Methods: Important but not Scary
## OzGrav ECR Workshop 2024 

This is a rough transcript of a talk I presented to the early career researcher (ECR) workshop at the OzGrav 2024 retreat, hosted at the University of Queensland. You can download the slides directly [here]().

This is aimed at graduate students and early career post-docs, aiming to cover two main areas:
1. That the tendency to treat statistical methods as black boxes can lead to dangerous failure modes 
2. Despite their reputation, stats methods are actually quite easy to understand, and even a basic understanding equips you to know what tools will / won't fail in different jobs.

Part one: why stats methods are important, and something we, as scientists, need a functional understanding of even if they aren't the main focus of our work.
