# New Tools for an Old Job  

## Mount Stromlo Student Seminar 2023

This talk was presented at the Mount Stromlo Student Seminar, a conference for astrophysics grad students from across australia to come together to present their research. In this talk from the very beginning of my PhD, I introduced myself to the rest of the astro community and gave an introduction to Reverberation Mapping and my work with modelling time series signals with Gaussian Processes.
